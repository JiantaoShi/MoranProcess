# Characterizing cancer initiation by Moran Process
It has been shown that the age incidence of chronic myeloid leukemia can be explained by a one-mutation Moran process model (Michor, Iwasa, and Nowak 2006). Moran process assumes the total number of cells is fixed over time, thus when a cell divides, another cell will be chosen by random to die. This model is in general useful to describe cancer initiation since the total number of pre-cancer cells tends to be stable. Here we implemented Moran process in Rcpp and apllied it to clone expansion of acute myeloid leukemia.
